Maybe I should keep a record of things I have been looking as I try to not go insane looking for a new job, so, here we go:

[TOC]

## Microservices
Can say I did edited the Portuguese Wikipedia article and added another paragraph. I also create a new Github repo to follow two tutorials I want to go through before I sit down to read a whole book or something.

Bonus: Some more practice with Flak and SqlAlchemy.

## [Elixr](https://elixir-lang.org/) and Phoenix
Another Brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· (huehuebr) programming language that took the world by storm. 

I had a look at it before, same for Erlang. I really want to have an excuse to use [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) but let's see how long I can give it the proper attention required to be competent with it. Got some errors before installing Elixir with the install script (and even after that I got errors because the expected database didn't existed in the Postgres container). I'll make sure to finish the official guide.


## Cedar Tools
I've been trying for a while to run the [Cedar Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_(programming_language)#Cedar) as it is present on the archive at the [Xerox PARC Archive](https://xeroxparcarchive.computerhistory.org/) I did succeeded a few months ago by running SunOS on Qemu only to realize some modules like DES encryption are missing. I have some more stuff I had a look from the older PARC stuff like the Alto in there too, like trying to... understand the font formats. One thing missing is my attempt at finding a [BCPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL) compiler for X86_64 Linux. Yes, BCPL the same language B is based on. Long story short, I could not get a good grasp of it or generate nativa binaries even for x86.

Oh btw, Java was inspired by the language that came before Cedar, [Mesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_(programming_language)).

## Reading the book Learning React
And I'm finally taking ReactJS seriously and reading the book _Learning React_ and keeping some notes at: <https://github.com/xspager/LerningReactNotes>


## LZMA URL
Really old project, I would have to look at the commit logs but I think I only added some JS to clear the default text and a about menu item. Yes, I tried to mimic the visual of Plan 9's and Inferno's Acme.

## Apache Airflow
Just had a look to see what it is all about. It's written in Python and easy to try locally.

## Apache Kafka
Another one I just had a look need time and maybe a need to look into more than read the documentation.
