So for some reason you could not do anything to prevent you and hit rock bottom? I'm sorry about that, and be sure you can always find/fight your way back.

## How do you reboot yourself?

How do you restart from scratch? The answer is pretty simple, you just do something new, use something you already had or know and just start again. Might sound easy but it's not, you probably already painted yourself into a corner and need to jump out of that corner.

## First step

You might want to make a list of all things you wish you could be doing but is not able right now, so you can do when things are better. It might include going out more, or being in nature or even just take one day a week to rest.

Let's see. You weren't born from an egg and probably did't learn to read on you own, somebody helped to get to this point, someone might help you again. Reach out even to people you might thing didn't like you, they might still help you, they may even not hate you and may give you some advice.

## Second step

Once you get some hope you better manage it well, is your way out very likely to succeed? Do you have to remember to keep doing something or can you just work on the solution? It's very important to not get stuck just keeping up here, and remember that you need to progress beyond this stage and it will require you not forget that.

## Third step

Do not let yourself get too comfortable but relax a bit, for how much time you can go before you need to think how well you doing and what other option you may have now? You might still ask for help until you are really sure out of the hole.

## Fourth step

And then is time to put some effort to broad your options, can you just move to something else that is guaranteed to work? Find the time to learn something you might need before that.

## Fifth and final step

At this point you should be ready or about to return to the daily routine you had before. Things should be manageable and your job now is stay here and mind the traps. You can hit the bottom all over again and getting all the help you can to keep a health routine, to change bad habits you might already be getting back to. You might invest in relationships with people who share the things from the list we made before. Someone, preferably multiple people to go along or to check on you to make sure you keep your head above the water.

## Notes

As of the writing of this I'm really close to the bottom again but I hope writing something, given my previous experiences, could help someone.

Do not despair, do not give up. Even if your brain is right and are a big failure the feeling and ideas you might be having are not the kind you should probably be listening to. Nobody is a failure forever, and you probably just make a few bad judgement here and there anyway. Do not despair. Theres a lot life to be had yet.

Ask people for help, ask people online for help if you need, ask for advice. There might people dedicated to help you in you current situation, from your job, from local government or from some other organization that might be better suited for your particular case. Look for those.
